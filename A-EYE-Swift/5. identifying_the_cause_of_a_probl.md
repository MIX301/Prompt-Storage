The failed pushes are coming from the stale submodule entry that was created when `WebInterface` was first added as an embedded Git repo. In your current HEAD tree, `WebInterface` is still recorded as a gitlink (`160000` entry pointing at commit `306dba395ad66746beb31ee6f68480a53b9ddb56`), but that commit no longer exists locally (see `git cat-file -t 306dba...` failing). When GitHub receives this tree it rejects it with the HTTP 400 you’re seeing. Clean up the submodule reference (e.g., `git rm --cached WebInterface`, then add the folder contents normally and commit) and the push will succeed.
