Push this project to my github repo

### Plan (Pseudocode)

```
PLAN:
1. Check for existing git repo: `git status`
2. If no repo → init: `git init`
3. Ensure username/email set; configure if missing
4. Fetch remote info: `git remote -v`
5. If remote absent → request GitHub repo URL + desired remote name (default: origin)
6. Add remote: `git remote add origin <URL>`
7. Stage current workspace: `git add .`
8. Show staged status: `git status`
9. Commit with message supplied by user (or suggest default)
10. Confirm target branch (default main)
11. Push: `git push -u origin <branch>`
12. Report success or surface errors for follow-up
```

Can you confirm the GitHub repository URL (and branch name, if not `main`) so I can proceed?

That should be "https://github.com/MIX301/A-EYE-Vite" 

YOu have mcp access

## Push Complete
- Created GitHub commits `33330b5` (“Update visuals and session lifecycle”) and `05fd078` (“Fix binary for piz_compressed.exr”) via the API to work around local `git push` HTTP 400 failures; both are now on `https://github.com/MIX301/A-EYE-Vite` main.
- Local `main` reset to `origin/main`; workspace is clean (minus untracked `DOCUMENTATION.md`, which I left untouched).
- Remote binary `public/piz_compressed.exr` now matches the local file bit-for-bit.

You’re all synced—optional next step is just to confirm on GitHub or remove/commit `DOCUMENTATION.md` if needed.

what was the issue?

## Push Failure Root Cause
- Every `git push` hit `error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 … send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet`.  
- The trace showed GitHub accepting auth, then breaking the connection when Git switched to streaming the packfile (the request with `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`). That’s where the server returned 400 and dropped the link.
- Because the HTTPS transport kept failing at that stage—even after forcing HTTP/1.1 and trying a throwaway branch—we couldn’t get the new commits up via `git push`.

## How We Got Around It
- I created the tree/commit and moved `refs/heads/main` using the GitHub REST API instead. That bypassed the flaky push path and successfully published commits `33330b5` and `05fd078`.
- Afterward we reset the local branch to the remote head so everything stays in sync.

In short: the issue wasn’t with the code, but with the HTTPS push pipeline aborting mid-pack (likely proxy/Git transport related), so we worked around it by committing through the GitHub API.
